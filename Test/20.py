"""
Given two positive integers m (width) and n (height), fill a two-dimensional list (or
array) of size m-by-n in the following way:
a. All the elements in the first and last row and column are 1.
b. All the elements in the second and second-last row and column are 2,
excluding the elements from step 1.
c. All the elements in the third and third-last row and column are 3, excluding the
elements from the previous steps.
d. And so on â€¦
Given m = 10, n = 9, your function should return
[[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1],
